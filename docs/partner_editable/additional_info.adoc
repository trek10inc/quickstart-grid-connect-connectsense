== Post-deployment steps

After you've deployed the stack, you must retrieve the API Gateway URL and API key so that you can configure your {partner-product-short-name}. After you retrieve these values, you use them to connect any {partner-product-short-name} to the IoT endpoint, as described in the following sections.

=== Retrieve the API Gateway URL and API key

. Open the AWS CloudFormation console, and choose your deployed stack. 
. Retrieve the API Gateway URL.
.. Choose the *Outputs* tab.
.. Copy the value of the *ApiGatewayURL* key, and save the value for use in configuring your {partner-product-short-name}.
. Retrieve the API key's physical ID.
.. Choose the *Resources* tab.
.. In the *Logical ID* column, find *ApiKey*, and choose its *Physical ID* link. For example, see the circled link in <<api-key-id>>.

[start=3]
.. Next to *API key*, choose *Show*, as shown in <<api-key>>. This reveals the ID value required for registering your physical device. Save this value for use in configuring your {partner-product-short-name}.

=== Configure the {partner-product-short-name} with your new IoT endpoint

To configure your {partner-product-short-name}, you need the Python script that's maintained and hosted by ConnectSense in their GitHub repository. 

. Download the https://github.com/connectsense/quickstart-devkit-device-connection[ConnectSense Device Connection repository^], and retrieve the script. 
. Follow the configuration steps in the repository. You need the API Gateway URL and the API key that you retrieved earlier. (See link:#_retrieve_the_api_gateway_url_and_api_key[Retrieve the API Gateway URL and API key].)

=== Create an Amazon QuickSight dashboard

You can use Amazon QuickSight to create a dashboard to visualize the metrics from the connected {partner-product-short-name}. Follow these steps to set up a dashboard for visualizing the watts used by the connected {partner-product-short-name} over time.

.    	From the AWS Management Console, open the QuickSight console.
.    	Choose *New Analysis*, *New Dataset*, *AWS IoT Analytics*.
.    	Choose the AWS IoT Analytics dataset that was created by your stack named `ConnectSenseQuickstartDataset`.
.    	Choose *Create data source*, *Visualize*.
.    	In the *Visual types* panel, choose *Line Chart*.
.    	Choose *Field wells* at the top to expand the panel of field wells, as shown in <<field-wells>>.

[start=7]
. From the *Fields list*, drag the *datetime* label into the *X axis* field well. Choose the down arrow next to `datetime (MINUTE)`, and for aggregate, choose *minute*.
. From the *Fields list*, drag the *watts* label into the *Value* field well. Choose the down arrow next to `watts (Median)`, and for aggregate, choose *average*.
.	From the *Fields list*, drag the *thing_name* label into the *Color* field well.
+
Your field wells now look something like <<field-wells-units>>.

You now see the watts plotted something like <<quicksight-data-viz>>:
